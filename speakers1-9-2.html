        <td colspan="2"><p><span class="abstract">Abstract:</span> The talk gives a survey of the basic ideas and recent result on fault diagnosis and reconfigurable control of discrete-event systems that are modelled as input-output automata. Faults and failures in the system change the state transition function of the plant and lead to a set of models, where each of the models represent the plant in one of the fault modes. They can be detected and isolated by deciding which element of the model set is consistent with the measured input and output sequences. Fault tolerance of the controller is obtained by a trajectory re-planning and an adaptation of the control algorithm. The methods are illustrated by several examples.</p>

Then we focus on bounded-confidence opinion models, including the Hegselmann-Krause model and Deffuant-Weisbuch model.   For such models, we demonstrate their disagreement phenomena: fragmentation and fluctuation, with strict mathematical analysis; we discuss the opinion intervention in order to alter opinion evolution in social networks, and theoretically prove that a simple noise injection strategy is effective to enhance the opinion agreement.</p>

        <td colspan="2"><p><span class="abstract">Abstract:</span> We discuss optimization problems where the objective function is submodular, which roughly means that it has the property of diminishing returns. In such problems, we can provably bound the performance of the greedy solution relative to the optimal solution. We present a variety of recent results related to such optimization problems, including bounds for "string-submodular" problems, bounds related to k-batch greedy strategies, improved bounds involving notions of curvature, and bounds on Nash equilibria in submodular games. We illustrate these results in the context of various application problems arising in task scheduling and adaptive sensing.</p>
